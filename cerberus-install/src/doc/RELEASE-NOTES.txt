2.1.2: 
	- fixed Google EventBus exception when undeploying the ear file. Was not passing the proper
	key into the map.remove()
	- added support for clients that are localhost-based. 
2.2
	- added support for motion detection commands to be received
		- client puts 'motion' in the url parameters in the post
		- using web sockets, this gets pushed to cerberus and an indicator will blink on the web app
	- upped session timeout from 30 to 55 minutes
2.2.1
	- added support for automatically creating directories if they don't exist
		inside the CameraImageManager
2.2.2
	- added further automatic directory creation for the ImageServlet
	- cleaned up code
2.2.3
	- added jquery onload event to the console to clear away any stale PINGs
	- added comments in the java code
	- updated documentation for installation instructions
	- added audio support (beep) for when a motion event comes in (console.js)
	
2.3.0
	- (big) switched from using .properties files in many places to using a database
		at first tried to use the built-in javadb/derby database - this was met with 
		great frustration when it came to managing users between gf and derby. Spent 
		several days on it. So, switched to the H2 db (not in-memory, but works well with java)
		and was up in several hours.
	- (big) added cerberus-install project where the project can be setup and deployed, 
		all from within the unpacked tar or zip file it produces.
	- created scripts to automate (as much as possible) the cerberus deployment
	- made 2 versions of the landing zone (win and unix) 2nd class citizens of this project
		they are now packed with the install tar
	- swapped out the Properties service with the Persistence service
	
2.3.1
	- gave file managers their own table, rather than have that funky pipe-delim format
	- decreased the prime faces idletimeout value to account for web socket disconnects over time
	- added new FilteredTimedManager class
	- added a purge that will remove images from the image directory but leave a handful of them
		(8) so it doesn't interfere too much with file i/o 
	
2.3.1.1
	- gave ability to enable/disable the purge from the database
	
2.3.1.2
	- ran FindBugs program and addressed the following:
		> incorrect way to populate the cached DIRECTORIES list for the FileManagers
		> possible NULL dereference situation with the RequestGateKeeper.java
	- added static final Strings for some performance critical log messages
	- fixed concurrent mod exception in event bus during dispose()
	
2.4.0.0
	- added capability to view images sent by the monitor clients when motion was detected (UI updates)
	- made file name creation faster in the CameraImageManager
	- removed all ManagedBean annos and replaced with Named (except for application scoped gateways)

2.4.1
	- normalized the database a bit more
	- added new entities to support that normalization
	- refactored the FileManager interface:
		- enable/disable the manager (only on startup though)
		- is the FileManager handling files? yes/not
			- one that does not is the PingPurge for example
			
2.4.2
	- upgraded to target the following:
		PrimeFaces from 4.0 to 5.0
		Java SE 7 to 8
		Glassfish 4.0 to 4.1
	- should still be backwards compatible
	- adjusted growl message
	- removed console.css stylesheet
	- shrank the Stand By image a bit
	
2.4.3
	- upgraded the following
		PrimeFaces from 5.0 to 5.1
		Atmosphere from 2.1.3 to 2.2.2
	- changed the directories in the db loaders
		ex: /opt/apps/cerberus/lz instead of /opt/lz
	- Upgraded from java.io.File to java.nio.Path / java.nio.Files
		> everywhere except the ImageServlet
	- separated the random stamp and the timestamp for files: previously a random stamp was added to the timestamp
